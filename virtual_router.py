# Virtual router for testing SWP exchange when no router available
# Peter Walker April 2022.
#
# - ... Actually just a simple server listening for SWP08 messages
# - validates messages with checksum and replies with ACK for valid or NAK for invalid messages received.
# - On receipt of a "Connect" message will also reply back with a Connect message.
# - TODO, should really respond to a Connect message with a Connected message to properly emulate a router.
# - TODO, add support for other message types if when adding them to swp_message/connectIO to help debug/test
#
