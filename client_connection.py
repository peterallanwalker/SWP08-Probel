# - V02 - add timestamps to messaging
# - and a log, though that should maybe be in the router
# - router holds msg objects, connection currently only the byte strings, could just convert them again when accessing
# - from the log vs storing msg objects... connection should call back to the router with a confirmed timestamp,
# - have the router then log it, in a separate class.

# - TODO - fix connection retry / reconnect (think it woks for CSCP but isn't for SWP)
