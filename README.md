#SWP08/Probel
###Router control using the [SWP08/Probel protocol](https://wwwapps.grassvalley.com/docs/Manuals/sam/Protocols%20and%20MIBs/Router%20Control%20Protocols%20SW-P-88%20Issue%204b.pdf)
(Other versions of the protocol doc are available in [this repo's protocol docs folder](https://github.com/peterallanwalker/SWP08-Probel/tree/master/protocol%20docs))

Source to destination cross-point switching and pushing of labels.

Tested with Calrec Brio audio mixer (does not support label pushing... test that), and Calrec Apollo+

Add debug info - (telnet into router, enter commands...)
